Potential questions
===================

- Packages by size
  - [Perl via MetaCPAN](http://explorer.metacpan.org/?url=%2Frelease%2F_search%3Fq%3Dstatus%3Alatest%26sort%3Dstat.size%3Adesc%26fields%3Dname%2Cstat.size%2Cdate%26size%3D100&content=)
    - https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/API-docs
    - https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-examples

- Similar projects
  - http://lumberjaph.net/graph/2010/03/25/github-explorer.html
  - https://github.com/hadley/r-on-github

- see how interconnected classes are
  - inheritance
  - attributes
  - function calls

- code coverage of test suites

- New users
  - <http://blogs.perl.org/users/ron_savage/2013/08/volunteer-time-series-stats-of-new-pause-ids.html>
  - <http://neilb.org/2013/08/16/cpan-buddy-system.html>


- investigate tools for mirroring dependencies
  - what happens when the repository goes down?
  - what happens when a package is deleted by the author
  - what happens when the author is not responding to bug reports / patches?
  - Maven [Java]: <http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/> via <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-08-15#i_17739>

- look at other relationships beyond dependencies: suggested packages,  links

Fun:
